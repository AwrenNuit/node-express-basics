# Node & Express Basics

## Description
Here are is a basic example of how you can use Node with Express. None of this is flashy or fancy. There are code comments with a high-level explanation of what's going on. I tried to avoid technical jargon and instead break things down into simple language. This quick setup is meant to help people get a project up and running quickly so they can see how everything fits together and mess around with it. If you're not breaking something or seeing what it can do, then are you really learning? :)

[Node](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/getting-started-guide/) and [Express](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html) have wonderful docs, too!
